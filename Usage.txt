USAGE:

- You can use Cetus to find all the memory addresses used by the game that match the given value. For a regular integer, we choose i32 
  (32-bit integer) in Value Type.
- Cetus also allows you to search for numbers with decimals (usually called floats), represented by the f32 and f64 types.
- For strings encoded in ascii, utf-8 or bytes. 
- You need to specify the data type as part of your search because, for your computer, the values 32 (integer) and 32.0 (float) are stored in 
  different formats in memory.
  
  
COMPARISON OPERATORS:

OPERATOR		DESCRIPTION

EQ			Find all memory addresses with contents that are EQUAL to our inputted value.
NE			Find all memory addresses with contents that are NOT EQUAL to our inputted value.
LT			Find all memory addresses with contents that are LOWER THAN our inputted value.
GT			Find all memory addresses with contents that are GREATER THAN our inputted value.
LTE			Find all memory addresses with contents that are LOWER THAN OR EQUAL to our inputted value.
GTE			Find all memory addresses with contents that are GREATER THAN OR EQUAL to our inputted value.



- After selecting an appropriate option for your Condition, Click on Search and You'll find Corresponding Memory Address with it's Value (in Hexadecimal).
- You can Bookmark the Address and View further it in Bookmarks tab.

- Empty Value can be used for Differential Search to look for memory positions based on specific variations on the value, rather than the value itself.

- Initially, This will return the total number of memory addresses mapped by the game.
- Suppose you want to know which memory addresses have decreased since the last search. You can run a second search using the LT operator without 
  setting a value to search.
- Now, you can continue to do successive searches.

- For example, if you now wanted to know which of the remaining resulting memory addresses from the first search have increased their value, you 
  can simply do another search with the GT operator with no value again.
  
- If you are searching for a particular value, you can continue to do more searches until you find the memory address you are trying to get.
