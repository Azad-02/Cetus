Installing Cetus on FireFox

- To run Cetus on Firefox, you will need to load it as a temporary extension since it isn't available on the add-ons website. To do this, 
  open Firefox and type about:debugging in the address bar. Once in there, go to This Firefox, where you'll find a button to load temporary 
  add-ons. 
- Temporary add-ons will only be loaded for as long as the browser remains open, so you'll need to load it again if you close it for 
  some reason.
- To load the extension, you will need to browse to the directory where you downloaded and extracted Cetus and select the manifest.json 
  file inside the main folder and click OK.


Installing Cetus on Chrome

- To install Cetus on Chrome, type chrome://extensions in your address bar. This will take you to the extensions manager. You will need to enable
  the Developer mode, enabling additional buttons to load the extension. Click the Load unpacked button and point to the directory where you 
  uncompressed the plugin.
- This will open an explorer window where you'll need to go to the directory where Cetus was uncompressed, and press the Open button from there 
  without selecting any file.
- Once you are done, you should see Cetus loaded in your extensions.


ACCESSING Cetus

- To find Cetus, you need to open the Developer tools by clicking on more tools in the button on the upper-right corner of Chrome.
- Cetus is located in one of the tabs there (under >> symbol)
- With Cetus open, hit the refresh button to reload the game.

Note: If Cetus shows the "Waiting for WASM" message, just reload the game, and the tools should load.
